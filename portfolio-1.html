      <h2>What is Patient-Centered Design?</h2>
      <p>Listening to the stories and journeys of patients, caregivers and support networks to identify problems, gather insight and co-create innovative solutions.</p>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>The fellowship team developed and conducted user-centered research to inform and validate design thinking. We advocated for large and diverse user insight throughout the system design cycle. We translated insights from interviews and research into actionable strategic solutions for Rush. To support the design team at Rush, we developed a design thinking workshop and a field guide to patient-centered design.</p>
